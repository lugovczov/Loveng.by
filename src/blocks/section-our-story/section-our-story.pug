          .large-text "Let's face it, learning UX/UI has never been accessible or affordable. For the last decade, courses have cost on average $15,000 and have been taught from classrooms in the priciest cities in the world. We're doing things a little different, without VC money, and with an awesome community in 91 countries around the world! Our goal is to make learning UX/UI accessible for anyone. <br><br> With Memorisely, you're not paying thousands of dollars extra because we rented a classroom in a prime city location. We connect you with 10 designers around the world and teach you live wherever you are with the latest real-time design tools."
