People are constantly asking questions, sharing resources, and giving feedback without a sense of “what’s in it for me.” The content Zander creates is excellent, but the community he’s fostered is the real gold. It’s made me feel that I can travel just about anywhere now and link up with a Memorisely designer for a cold beer and a genuine conversation."',

It\'s a great way keep motivated and share your thoughts so you can get more points of views of the topic. Also, as I struggle a little with English thanks to the Book Club comments I can understand better the ideas in the book 😀"',
